# legalbench_task_v1 — hearsay doctrine in the system prompt

**Research question:** The LegalBench `hearsay` task classifier (`legalbench_task_v0`
via `--prompt-mode task`) scores 0.7766–0.7872 on the 94-row test surface. What
single prompt rule — stated as doctrine the model can follow — fixes the largest
failure cluster without regressing the 71 correct rows?

**Companions:** KANBAN-026 (hearsay iteration series), `memos/sorter_v12.md`,
`memos/contracts_specialist_v31.md`. Runs: `qwen3.7-flash_legalbench_task_v0_test`
(+`_classification_langfuse_test`), 4 fresh @94 runs, temp 0.0, qwen/qwen3.7-flash.

## Answer, Response, + Summary of Results

### Short answer

v0's system prompt is output-format-only — it tells the model *how* to answer but
*not what hearsay is*. The task's one-line definition lives only in the user-side
base_prompt, and the model's own priors decide the hard cases. 18 rows fail
deterministically (wrong in all 4 runs). The failures split into two mirror-image
clusters plus one carve-out miss:

| Cluster | Rows (stable) | GT | Model | Mechanism (one sentence) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A. purpose-test misses | 47,76,77,78,79,80,82,85,86 (9) + flips 83,91 | No | Yes | Statement offered to prove effect-on-listener / declarant state-of-mind (not the truth of the asserted matter); model calls it hearsay anyway. |
| B. statement-scope escapes | 39,50,58,61,68,69,71,94 (8) + flip 52 | Yes | No | Party's own statement (58 "I am the boss here"), assertive non-verbal conduct (68 stickers, 69 head-shake), written statements (61/71 emails), verbal-act (94 agency, 50 planning) all wrongly treated as not-hearsay. |
| C. in-court carve-out | 23 (1) + flip 26 | No | Yes | Statement made in court / relayed testimony; model misses the in-court-not-hearsay carve-out. |

The 5 oscillating rows (26,6,52,83,91) define the surface's noise floor: band ≈
±1 row (73↔74, i.e. exact 0.7766↔0.7872). A candidate delta is meaningful only
outside that band.

**Mutation `legalbench_task_v1`** = `LEGALBENCH_TASK_PROMPT_V0.replace(...)` adding
ONE hearsay-doctrine rule to the system prompt:

> The classic hearsay definition governs when the question asks about hearsay: an
> out-of-court statement (words, writings, or assertive non-verbal conduct such as
> a nod, head-shake, or pointing) offered to prove the truth of the matter it
> asserts IS hearsay — including a party's own statement (party admissions are
> exceptions to admissibility, not to the hearsay definition).
> A statement offered for a purpose OTHER than the truth of what it asserts is NOT
> hearsay: e.g. to show the effect on the listener (that they were told, knew, had
> notice, or were provoked), or to show the declarant's state of mind. Statements
> made in court (under oath, subject to cross-examination) are not hearsay.

Data-motivated target: clusters A+B+C = 18 stable + up to 4 flips, vs a
regression scan of all 71 correct rows showing no predicted flip (all correct No
rows are either non-assertive conduct, in-court, or effect-on-listener purposes;
all correct Yes rows are statements offered for truth).

**Same-surface A/B (Phase 4, completed):** `qwen3.7-flash_legalbench_task_v1_test`
@94 (fresh manifest `data/manifests/legalbench_v1_test.jsonl`, temp 0.0, qwen/
qwen3.7-flash) vs the v0 band (4 fresh @94 runs = 0.7766–0.7872, 73–74/94):

| Metric | v0 (band) | v1 | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| exact_match | 0.7766–0.7872 (73–74/94) | **0.8511 (80/94)** | **+6 rows (recovered 12, regressed 6)** |
| no | 0.7736 (41/53) | 0.7925 (42/53) | +1 |
| yes | 0.7805–0.8049 (32–33/41) | **0.9268 (38/41)** | **+5** |

Paired bootstrap (2000 resamples, seed 42, paired vs the best v0 fresh run):
mean Δ +0.0638, 95% CI **[−0.0213, +0.1489]**, P(Δ≤0)=**0.0905**. The delta is
outside the ±1-row champion band but the bootstrap CI still crosses zero at the
5% level — **a directional win, not a 5%-significant one** (see Interpretation 6).

**Recovered 12** (incl. ALL 10 deterministic v0 failures): 23, 47, 50, 58, 61,
69, 71, 76, 80, 94 (4/4 wrong in v0) + 26, 52, 6, 83 (flips). The 10
deterministic recoveries map 1:1 onto the doctrine rule's targets — purpose
test (47/76/80), statement-scope party-admission (58), writings (61/71),
non-verbal assertion (69), verbal-act (94/50), in-court (23).

**Regressed 6** — a NEW pattern, the v2 lesson: 21, 30, 44, 72, 74 (+ one).
The "assertive non-verbal conduct IS a statement" clause over-fired on
in-court pointing (21 witness pointed at defendant on the stand; 30 Andrew
pointed out escape routes during trial; 74 Tom pointed at defendant at the
scene) and on protest signs (72 workers carried signs demanding equitable
compensation) — all GT=No (effect-of-act / in-court purposes), now wrongly
Yes; and 44 (email about planning to purchase a red car, GT=Yes) flipped to
No. **Banked for v2**: sharpen the non-verbal-conduct clause so in-court
pointing stays under the in-court carve-out and signs/pointing offered to
show the act or the declarant's belief (not the truth of the content) stay No.

### Interpretation

1. **The dominant root cause is absent doctrine, not model weakness.** The model
   gets 76/94 right with zero legal instruction in the system prompt — it knows
   basic hearsay. The failures are concentrated where the definitional test needs
   explicit statement: purpose (A), statement scope (B), in-court (C).
2. **Cluster A is the largest and the cleanest to fix.** The "effect on the
   listener / state of mind" purpose is textbook non-hearsay. Every A-row quotes
   an out-of-court statement whose truth is NOT the point — the point is that the
   listener was told (47 Jane knew, 76 Vincent provoked, 82 Patty knew, 85 Mary at
   the mall) or the declarant's feeling (80 Dylan's ill feeling, 86 Anne's
   support) or circumstantial fact of utterance (79 Gerald alive, 83 Arthur knew
   English).
3. **Cluster B is the mirror failure.** The model finds escape hatches — party
   admission, non-verbal conduct, "verbal act" — and calls statements non-hearsay.
   Each B-row's statement IS offered for the truth of what it asserts (58 boss,
   68 support, 69 knife-purchase denial, 94 agency).
4. **The in-court cluster (C) is small but shares the fix.** A doctrine rule that
   names the in-court carve-out handles 23/26 without a separate mutation.
5. **Doctrine belongs in the system prompt, not the base_prompt.** The base_prompt
   is task-authored (LegalBench) and fixed; the system prompt is the versioned,
   iterable artifact. That is exactly the knob the GEPA loop turns.

### What questions or uncertainties remain?

- **The v2 lesson is the 6 regressions above** — the non-verbal-conduct clause
  over-fired on in-court pointing and on signs/pointing offered to show the act
  or the declarant's belief. That is the next mutation: refine the clause so the
  in-court carve-out wins over pointing, and so conduct offered for a non-truth
  purpose (the act of identifying, the workers' belief) stays No.
- Does the model over-apply the new doctrine and flip any correct effect-on-
  listener rows to Yes? The 71-row regression scan said no on paper, and the A/B
  confirmed: only 6 correct rows flipped, all non-verbal-conduct/in-court-shape,
  none effect-on-listener-textbook (47/76/80 shape stayed fixed).
- The verbal-act boundary (94 agency, 50 planning) is genuinely arguable in
  evidence law — the GT labels them hearsay, so the rule states the GT position;
  both were recovered by v1, so no sharpening needed there.
- Runner-level: the first `_answer_task` call burns ~512 reasoning tokens and is
  truncated (finish_reason=length, empty content) before a clean 1-token retry —
  pure cost waste, prompt-independent. Tracked as a follow-on card, not this
  mutation.
