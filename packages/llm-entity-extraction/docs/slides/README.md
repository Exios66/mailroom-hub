# Scoring Methods — Slides

Example inputs, outputs, and concise scientific explanations of every method
used to score the entity-extraction runs in this project — written for
research scientists working in parallel who do **not** have time to read the
full documentation set (`SCORING.md` → now [`docs/SCORING.md`](../SCORING.md), README, AGENTS.md).

Each deck is standalone: a ~5–8 slide markdown file with the method, a
worked example (input → output → calculation), interpretation, and common
pitfalls. Read them in order, or jump to what you need. Decks 01–07
explain the scoring methods; **decks 08–11 are the prompt-iteration
post-mortems** — the problems encountered while tuning the sorter and the
contracts specialist, and the fixes each version applied, with the A/B
numbers that validated them (sorter problems → sorter fixes, specialist
problems → specialist fixes); **deck 12 covers the metrics beyond the CUAD
extraction surface** (subtype, docclass hierarchical, task-aware MAUD /
LegalBench / multiclass / chained, and the Monte Carlo robustness suite).

| [04-regression-diagnostics](04-regression-diagnostics.md) | MAE, median AE, R² (dates / durations / money) + span-count drift, vs the master-labels ground truth | You need to know HOW WRONG the near-misses are, not just how often |

| [07-reading-the-log](07-reading-the-log.md) | How to read `reports/experiment_log.md` / `.jsonl` and the GH Pages site (CIs, same-surface rule) | You want to compare runs without being misled by sample size |

| [10-problems-contracts-specialist](10-problems-contracts-specialist.md) | Problems encountered across the specialist prompt iterations (v15→v26): scope/grain divergence, over-extraction, ellipsis/dedupe losses, the reasoning confound, the self-inflicted v24/v25 format regressions | You want to know WHY the extractor misses or breaks spans |
| [11-fixes-contracts-specialist](11-fixes-contracts-specialist.md) | Fixes applied to the specialist across versions (v18 family-fidelity catalog → v26 containment fix) with A/B numbers | You want the full fix history, wave by wave, with the numbers that validated each version |

## One-paragraph summary (the whole project's scoring in 90 seconds)

Every run sends real documents through LangChain agents (sorter → specialist
extractor) via OpenRouter, then scores the outputs **deterministically**
locally: each extracted field is scored by its declared type (`date`, `money`,
`name`, `free_text`, `id`, `entity_list`) against the CUAD ground truth —
never by exact-match-on-extraction. The headline `overall_extraction_score`
is the mean of per-field content scores. On top of that, every run carries
**run-level diagnostics** (`scores.diagnostics`): raw list precision/recall/F1
(macro + micro), **MAE + R²** regression errors for dates, durations, and
money amounts vs the curated master-labels CSV, **span-count drift** (over-
vs under-extraction), and a per-field **exact / partial / miss**
decomposition. Braintrust is only ever a lookup on these locally computed
composites, so the UI, the manifests, and the experiment log never disagree.
The scoring definitions all live in the shared **`llm-dojo-scoring` package**
(`@v0.2.0`; the repo's `src/*.py` are thin re-export shims), and the
**task-aware dispatcher** (`score_task`) extends the same deterministic
scoring to the sorter **subtype** eval, the hierarchical **docclass** eval
(doc_type + subclass with equivalence-aware scoring), **MAUD** (consideration
strict/equiv), **LegalBench** (binary P/R/F1), **multiclass**, **court
opinions**, and **chained** sorter→extractor composites (0.25/0.75). The
**Monte Carlo robustness suite** adds zero-spend committee-voting, escalation,
paired-bootstrap ablation, failure-pipeline, and exemplar metrics over the
stored reasoning corpus.

## How to verify a number yourself

Everything is reproducible offline:

```bash
# All metrics in one place (formulas + definitions)
less ../SCORING.md

# Unit tests for every metric (network-free)
python -m pytest tests/test_metrics.py -q

# The master ground-truth CSV the MAE diagnostics prefer
less ../llm-mailroom/data/cuad/master_clauses.csv
```
